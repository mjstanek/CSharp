// Created following along with the Microsoft Learn Course
// Challenge project - Create a mini-game
// in concurrence with the freeCodeCamp certification 

/*
- The code declares the following variables:
    - Variables to determine the size of the Terminal window.
    - Variables to track the locations of the player and food.
    - Arrays `states` and `foods` to provide available player and food appearances
    - Variables to track the current player and food appearance

- The code provides the following methods:
    - A method to determine if the Terminal window was resized.
    - A method to display a random food appearance at a random location.
    - A method that changes the player appearance to match the food consumed.
    - A method that temporarily freezes the player movement.
    - A method that moves the player according to directional input.
    - A method that sets up the initial game state.

- The code doesn't call the methods correctly to make the game playable. The following features are missing:
    - Code to determine if the player has consumed the food displayed.
    - Code to determine if the food consumed should freeze player movement.
    - Code to determine if the food consumed should increase player movement.
    - Code to increase movement speed.
    - Code to redisplay the food after it's consumed by the player.
    - Code to terminate execution if an unsupported key is entered.
    - Code to terminate execution if the terminal was resized.
